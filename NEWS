1.3-0 (2023-11-17) - Faria, J. C.
 * Adjustment of files encoding as required by the CRAN.
 * Adjustments and improvements were made to the documentation
   of the package and functions.

1.2-6 (2021-10-11) - Faria, J. C.
 * The "na.omit" function, previously used in several methods of the package,
   has been removed. The main use was in the functions: "fdt.default",
   "make.ft.multiple", "fdt_cat.default", "fdt_cat.matrix" and "fdt_cat.data.frame".
 * Added "na.rm" argument to methods associated with default FALSE.
   If you have NA values that can influence the structure of the table,
   the user will receive a error message.

1.2-5 (2020-04-17) - Allaman, I. B.
 * Correction of wording of argument x in file fdt.Rd. Removed the snippet
   "or character/factor ('fdt_cat')".
 * The functions latex.fdt, latex.fdt_cat, latex.fdt_cat.multiple,
   print.latex.fdt and summary.latex.fdt was deprecated. Add the new class to
   the xtable function: xtable.fdt and xtable.fdt.multiple.
 * Corrected bug in plot.fdt.default function, types "cdh" and "cdp".
   The relative frequencies not was divide by h (amplitude of the class).
 * Add news arguments in the plot.fdt.multiple: grouped - if the "by"
   argument is different from NULL, then the users have the option the to plot
   factors in a the same graphics; args.legend - a list with the same arguments
   of the legend function of the graphics package.

1.2-4 (2018-02-17) - Allaman, I. B.
 * Only available on GitHub (under test)

   fdt_cat.matrix functions were changed.
 * Was added the latex.fdt_cat.multiple function to give suport the objects
   of the fdt_cat.multiple class

	  make.fdt.format.classes, make.fdt.multiple and make.fdt.simple were moved
   from the documentation

1.2-0 (2014-10-13) - Faria, J. C.

	* plot.fdth.multiple: x11() was replaced by the portable way dev.new()
 * The documentation has been deeply improved
 * Export LaTeX table of the frequency distribution table (latex.fdt)

1.1-7 (2012-04-02) - Faria, J. C.
	* Cosmetic changes to meet the requirements of CRAN

1.1-6 (2011-08-21) - Faria, J. C.
	* The S3 methods print.fdt.default and print.fdt.multiple were improved.
 * The S3 methods summary.fdt.default and summary.fdt.multiple were improved.

	* The S3 methods plot.default and plot.multiple were improved.
	  Both enable adding the count values to all types of plot

	* The MASS package is not essential and was removed from some examples
	  to avoid NOTES in compilation

1.1-1 (2010-05-22) - Faria, J. C.
	* The slot data was removed from the fdt object
 * The S3 methods plot.default and plot.multiple were improved

1.1-0 (2010-05-20) - Faria, J. C.
