 * The "na.omit" function, previously used in several methods of the package,
   has been removed. The main use was in the functions: "fdt.default",
   "make.ft.multiple", "fdt_cat.default", "fdt_cat.matrix" and "fdt_cat.data.frame".

 * Added "na.rm" argument to methods associated with default FALSE.
   If you have NA values that can influence the structure of the table, the user will
   receive a error message.

 * Correction of wording of argument x in file fdt.Rd. Removed the snippet
   "or character/factor ('fdt_cat')".
    
 * The functions latex.fdt, latex.fdt_cat, latex.fdt_cat.multiple,
   print.latex.fdt and summary.latex.fdt was deprecated. Add the new class to
   the xtable function: xtable.fdt and xtable.fdt.multiple.
    
 * Corrected bug in plot.fdt.default function, types "cdh" and "cdp".
   The relative frequencies not was divide by h (amplitude of the class).
    
 * Add news arguments in the plot.fdt.multiple: grouped - if the "by"
   argument is different from NULL, then the users have the option the to plot
   factors in a the same graphics; args.legend - a list with the same arguments
   of the legend function of the graphics package.
